# Collect liquid samples and deploy sensors at ports
**Main concepts:**
1. [Behavior trees](https://www.behaviortree.dev/) for managing multiple robot navigation and arm manipulation actions through Finite State Machines.
2. [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) for the navigation and manipulation nodes.
3. [Nav2](https://docs.nav2.org/) is used for navigation.
4. [MoveIt 2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html) is used for manipulation.
